# T5-Bootcamp
T5 Bootcamp project
This is a project for Sdaia T5 Bootcamp.
In this Project I am going to explore the dataset in https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset .
The dataset maps the cardiac condition of several patients (70k).
Also Iam going to predict if a given patient have a try a cardiovascular diseaseor not by using several algorithems such as logistic regression.
